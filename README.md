## 1. Challenge Overview

### Purpose

Today's chatbots and AI agents live on centralized platforms. There is no way to verify who operates them, what policies they follow, or whether they are legitimate. Users trust them blindly.

**Verana** is an open trust layer for the internet, built on decentralized identity (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (W3C). **Hologram** is a messaging app that works as a browser for verifiable AI agents: before interacting with a bot, users can confirm who operates it.

In this challenge, you will build a web platform that allows **anyone** — without technical knowledge — to create, configure, and publish their own personal AI agent (Persona AI Agent), accessible through Hologram.

### What You Will Learn

- Building chatbots with generative AI (LLMs, RAG, prompts, MCP)
- Integration with decentralized identity protocols (DIDs, Verifiable Credentials)
- Deploying services with Docker and Kubernetes
- Full-stack web application development
- Working with open-source repositories and GitHub collaboration
- Cutting-edge technologies: W3C, DIF, ToIP standards

### What You Will Deliver

1. **Custom test chatbot** — an AI bot running on Hologram (Step 1, in your fork of `eafit-challenge-agent-example`)
2. **Bot deployed on Kubernetes** — your chatbot publicly accessible (Step 2)
3. **"Persona AI Agent Creator" web platform** — a complete web application that allows non-technical users to create and manage their own personal AI agents (Step 3, in your fork of `eafit-challenge`)
4. **Code published on GitHub** — under an open-source license
5. **Documentation** — README with installation and usage instructions

---

## 2. Software and Tools

Below is a list of all the tools you will need. **Install them before you begin.**

### Code Editor (IDE)

Use one of the following editors. All are free and support TypeScript/JavaScript:

| IDE | Description | Download |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| **VS Code** | Most popular, extensions for everything | https://code.visualstudio.com |
| **Windsurf** | IDE with built-in AI (based on VS Code) | https://windsurf.com |
| **Cursor** | IDE with built-in AI (based on VS Code) | https://cursor.sh |

> Any of the three will work. If you have never used any of them, start with **VS Code**.

### Git and GitHub

- **Git**: version control system. Download: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- **GitHub**: code hosting platform. **Create a free account** at https://github.com if you don't have one.

Verify that Git is installed:

```bash
git --version
# Should show something like: git version 2.x.x
```

### Node.js and pnpm (for Step 3)

You will need **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime) and **pnpm** (package manager) for the web application in Step 3.

1. Install Node.js **v20 or higher**: https://nodejs.org (download the LTS version)
2. Install pnpm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Verify:

```bash
node --version
# Should show v20.x.x or higher

pnpm --version
# Should show 8.x.x or higher
```

### Docker

Docker lets you run applications in isolated containers. You will use it to run the chatbot and its associated services (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.).

- **Docker Desktop**: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- After installing, verify:

```bash
docker --version
# Should show: Docker version 2x.x.x

docker compose version
# Should show: Docker Compose version v2.x.x
```

### ngrok

ngrok creates a public tunnel to your local machine. This allows Hologram to connect to your chatbot during development.

1. Create a free account at https://ngrok.com
2. Download and install: https://ngrok.com/download
3. Authenticate with your token:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

4. Verify:

```bash
ngrok version
```

### Hologram Messaging

Hologram is the messaging app where users interact with verifiable AI agents. You will need it to test your chatbot.

- **iOS**: Search for "Hologram Messaging" on the App Store
- **Android**: Search for "Hologram Messaging" on Google Play
- **Web**: https://hologram.zone

> Install the app on your phone. You will use it to scan QR codes and chat with your bot.

### kubectl (for Step 2)

## 3. Development Environment Setup

Follow these steps **in order** to get your environment ready.

### 3.1. Install the tools

Make sure you have everything listed in the previous section installed:

- [ ] Code editor (VS Code, Windsurf, or Cursor)
- [ ] Git
- [ ] GitHub account
- [ ] Node.js v20+ (for Step 3)
- [ ] pnpm (for Step 3)
- [ ] Docker Desktop
- [ ] ngrok (with account and token configured)
- [ ] Hologram Messaging on your phone
- [ ] kubectl

### 3.2. Configure Git

If this is your first time using Git, set up your name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 3.3. Set up your SSH key on GitHub (recommended)

This allows you to push/pull without entering your password every time.

1. Generate an SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

2. Press Enter to accept the default location. Optionally add a passphrase.

3. Copy your public key:

```bash
# macOS
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy

# Linux
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -selection clipboard

# Windows (Git Bash)
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

4. Go to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key** and paste your key.

5. Verify the connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
# Should respond: Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated...
```

### 3.4. Get an API key from an LLM provider

Your chatbot needs to connect to a language model. You have several options:

| Provider | Recommended model | How to get API key |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **OpenAI** | `gpt-5.4-mini` | https://platform.openai.com/api-keys |
| **Anthropic** | `claude-4.6-sonnet` | https://console.anthropic.com |
| **Ollama** (local, free) | `llama3` | https://ollama.ai — no API key required |

> **Recommendation for students**: If you don't want to spend money, use **Ollama** with the `llama3` model. It runs locally on your machine. You need at least 8 GB of RAM.

To install Ollama:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Download the llama3 model
ollama pull llama3
```

### 3.5. Request Kubernetes credentials

For Step 2, you will need a `kubeconfig` file that gives you access to a namespace on the Verana Kubernetes cluster.

**Request your credentials on the Discord channel** (see next section). You will be assigned a namespace for your team.

---

## 4. Getting Help

### Verana Discord

Join the Verana Discord server and use the **#eafit-challenge** channel to:

- Ask technical questions
- Report issues
- Share your progress
- Request your kubeconfig for k8s

**Invitation link**: https://discord.com/invite/edjaFn252q

> Your Verana technical mentor will be available on this channel. Don't hesitate to ask.

### Additional resources

- Check the documentation at https://docs.verana.io
- Review the READMEs in each repository directory

---

## Step 1 — Getting Started with AI Chatbots and Hologram

**Goal**: Learn how to configure, customize, and run an AI chatbot that connects with Hologram Messaging.

**What you will learn**:
- How an LLM-based AI chatbot works
- Configuration of prompts, RAG, and agent packs
- How communication with Hologram works through VS Agent
- Docker Compose for orchestrating multiple services
- How a Verifiable Service obtains a Service credential from the organization

**What you will deliver**:
- A custom chatbot running locally, accessible from Hologram

---

### 1.1. Fork the example agent repository

The example agent lives in a separate repository. You will fork it and use it as a starting point.

1. Go to https://github.com/verana-labs/eafit-challenge-agent-example
2. Click the **"Fork"** button (top-right corner)
3. Select your personal account as the destination
4. This will create a copy at `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/eafit-challenge-agent-example`

### 1.2. Clone the repository to your machine

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/eafit-challenge-agent-example.git

# Enter the directory
cd eafit-challenge-agent-example
```

> If you didn't set up SSH, you can use HTTPS instead:
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/eafit-challenge-agent-example.git
> ```

### 1.3. Explore the project structure

Open the project in your editor:

```bash
code .      # for VS Code
# or
windsurf .  # for Windsurf
# or
cursor .    # for Cursor
```

The example agent is built with [hologram-generic-ai-agent-vs](https://github.com/2060-io/hologram-generic-ai-agent-vs). You can find other agent examples in [hologram-verifiable-services](https://github.com/2060-io/hologram-verifiable-services).

The repository structure:

```
eafit-challenge-agent-example/
├── config.env              # Service configuration (ports, org URLs, credDef, etc.)
├── agent-pack.yaml         # Agent personality, prompts, menus, MCP config
├── deployment.yaml         # Helm chart values for K8s deployment (Step 2)
├── common/
│   └── common.sh           # Shared shell helpers
├── docker/
│   └── docker-compose.yml  # Orchestration of all services
├── scripts/
│   ├── setup.sh            # Local setup (VS Agent + ngrok + Service credential)
│   └── start.sh            # Start the Docker Compose stack

└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── deploy.yml      # GitHub Actions workflow for K8s deployment (Step 2)
```

### 1.4. Configure environment variables

Open `config.env` in your editor. All defaults are preconfigured to work with the EAFIT Challenge infrastructure:

- The **organization** is already set to `organization.eafit.testnet.verana.network`
- The **credential definition** is hardcoded to the EAFIT Avatar's credDef
- The **VS Agent image** and **ports** are ready to use

> If you don't want to use OpenAI, you can configure any other LLM provider. Refer to the [agent pack schema](https://github.com/2060-io/hologram-generic-ai-agent-vs/blob/main/docs/agent-pack-schema.md) for available options (Ollama, Anthropic, etc.).

### 1.5. Customize your Agent Pack

The `agent-pack.yaml` file defines the personality, languages, prompt, menus, and MCP tools of your chatbot. Open it in your editor and customize:

- **`metadata`** — Agent name, description, and tags
- **`languages`** — Greeting messages and system prompts (en, es)
- **`llm`** — Model, temperature, and agent prompt
- **`rag`** — Knowledge base configuration
- **`flows`** — Authentication and menu behavior
- **`mcp`** — External tool integrations (e.g., GitHub)

> **Make it yours!** Change the agent name, greeting messages, system prompt, languages, etc.

### 1.6. Add documents for RAG (knowledge base)

If you want your chatbot to answer questions about specific topics, you can add remote document URLs in the `rag.remoteUrls` section of `agent-pack.yaml`. Supported formats:

- `.txt` — plain text
- `.md` — markdown
- `.pdf` — PDF documents
- `.csv` — tabular data

Example: add URLs to documents about EAFIT, your major, or any topic of interest.

### 1.7. Set up the VS Agent

The setup script deploys the VS Agent locally via Docker + ngrok, and obtains a **Service credential** from the EAFIT organization (proving your agent is a legitimate service in the ecosystem).

Make sure Docker Desktop and ngrok are running, then:

```bash
source config.env
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The script will:

1. **Pull and start the VS Agent container** (DIDComm messaging)
2. **Start an ngrok tunnel** to expose the agent publicly
3. **Obtain a Service credential** from the EAFIT organization at `organization.eafit.testnet.verana.network`

> The first time may take a few minutes while Docker images are downloaded.

### 1.8. Start the full stack

Once setup is complete, start all services (chatbot, Redis, PostgreSQL):

```bash
export NGROK_DOMAIN=<your-ngrok-domain>   # shown by setup.sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...              # your LLM API key
./scripts/start.sh
```

This will start:

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **vs-agent** | 3011 (public), 3010 (admin) | Communication with Hologram (DIDComm) |
| **chatbot** | 3003 | Your AI agent (LLM, RAG, MCP) |
| **redis** | 6379 | Memory and vector storage |
| **postgres** | 5432 | Session database |

Verify everything is running:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps
```

All services should show status `Up` or `running`.

### 1.9. Connect with Hologram and test

1. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3011/` — this shows the VS Agent invitation page with a QR code
2. Open the **Hologram Messaging** app on your phone
3. Scan the QR code
4. The chatbot will send you its greeting message
5. Open the menu and tap **Authenticate** to verify your identity with the EAFIT Avatar credential
6. Start chatting!

**Experiment**:
- Change the prompt in `agent-pack.yaml` and restart
- Add more documents for RAG
- Try different LLM models or providers
- Change the default language
- Add or modify MCP tool integrations

### 1.10. Commit your changes

Once your chatbot is working, save your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: configure my custom AI agent"
git push origin main
```

---

## Step 2 — Deploy Your Bot to Kubernetes

**Goal**: Learn how to deploy your chatbot to a Kubernetes cluster so it is publicly accessible without relying on ngrok or your local machine.

**What you will learn**:
- Basic Kubernetes concepts (pods, services, ingress)
- Helm charts for packaging deployments
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- GitHub Secrets for managing sensitive configuration

**What you will deliver**:
- Your chatbot deployed and publicly accessible at `https://<agentname>.agents.<team_name>.teams.eafit.testnet.verana.network`

---

### 2.1. Update your agent's public URL

Open `config.env` in your forked `eafit-challenge-agent-example` repository and set your `AGENT_PUBLIC_URL` following the naming convention:

```bash
AGENT_PUBLIC_URL="https://<agentname>.agents.<team_name>.teams.eafit.testnet.verana.network"
```

Replace `<agentname>` with your agent's name and `<team_name>` with your team's name.

Also update the ingress host in `deployment.yaml` to match:

```yaml
ingress:
  host: "<agentname>.agents.<team_name>.teams.eafit.testnet.verana.network"
```

### 2.2. Configure GitHub Secrets

In your forked repository, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add the following secrets:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `OVH_KUBECONFIG` | Kubeconfig for the K8s cluster (provided by the Verana team) |
| `K8S_NAMESPACE` | Your team's namespace (use your team name) |
| `EXAMPLE_AGENT_OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider key) |
| `EXAMPLE_AGENT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password (any secure string) |
| `EXAMPLE_AGENT_MCP_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `EXAMPLE_AGENT_WALLET_KEY` | Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `EXAMPLE_AGENT_VSAGENT_DB_PASSWORD` | VS Agent DB password (any secure string) |

> **Request your kubeconfig** on the Verana Discord (#eafit-challenge channel) if you haven't already.

### 2.3. Deploy with GitHub Actions

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that handles deployment automatically.

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your forked repository
2. Select the **"Deploy Example Agent"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Select step **`all`** to deploy and obtain credentials in one run

The workflow will:

1. **Deploy** your agent to the K8s cluster using Helm
2. **Obtain a Service credential** from the EAFIT organization (same as the local setup)

### 2.4. Verify the deployment

Once the workflow completes successfully:

```bash
# Optional: verify locally with kubectl
export KUBECONFIG=~/path/to/your/kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace>
# Should show STATUS: Running
```

Your agent's DID document should be accessible at:

```
https://<agentname>.agents.<team_name>.teams.eafit.testnet.verana.network/.well-known/did.json
```

### 2.5. Test with Hologram

1. Open **Hologram Messaging** on your phone
2. Navigate to your agent's public URL — it will show a QR code
3. Scan the QR code to connect
4. Verify the chatbot responds correctly (you no longer need ngrok!)

### 2.6. Commit and push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: configure k8s deployment"
git push origin main
```

---

## Step 3 — The Challenge: Online Service for Creating Persona AI Agents

**Goal**: Build a complete web application that allows users without technical knowledge to create, configure, and deploy their own personal AI agents through an intuitive interface.

**What you will learn**:
- Full-stack web application development
- Programmatic deployment management on Kubernetes
- User interface design (UI/UX)
- Integration of multiple services (LLMs, MCP, RAG, k8s)
- User authentication

**What you will deliver**:
- A functional web application for creating and managing Persona AI Agents
- At least 2 functional MCP integrations
- User and technical documentation

---

### What is a Persona AI Agent?

A **Persona AI Agent** is an AI agent that **represents a person** and can execute actions on their behalf.

**Example**: A plumber can have an AI Agent that manages their calendar. Clients connect to the agent through Hologram and have a conversation to schedule an appointment.

### 3.1. Web Application Requirements

Your application must provide:

#### Web Interface

- A modern web application with an intuitive interface
- Responsive (works on desktop and mobile)
- Suggested technology: React, Next.js, Vue.js, or your preference

#### Global Configuration

A configuration file (`.env` or similar) that defines:

- **kubeconfig**: path to the k8s credentials file for deploying bots to the cluster
- **Base domain**: suffix for user chatbot URLs, in the format: `<agentname>.agents.<team_name>.teams.eafit.testnet.verana.network`

#### User Authentication

- User login / registration
- Optional: Google authentication (OAuth)
- Logout

#### Bot Management ("My AI Bots")

- **List** my bots: view all AI agents I have created
- **Create** new bot: step-by-step form to configure a new agent
- **View** bot: detail page with the bot's configuration
  - **Edit**: modify the configuration
  - **Save**: persist changes
  - **Publish**: deploy the bot to k8s and make it accessible on Hologram
  - **Unpublish**: remove the bot from the cluster
  - **Link to bot**: button that opens the bot's public URL for scanning with Hologram

### 3.2. Bot Configuration Options

Each bot must be configurable with:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Persona Attributes** | Name, profession, description, photo — define the agent's identity (Persona Credential) |
| **Service Attributes** | Service name, description, category — define the service offered (Service Credential) |
| **Prompt** | Personality and behavior instructions for the AI agent |
| **MCP Services** | External tools the agent can use (calendar, social media, etc.) |
| **RAG** | Knowledge base: documents the agent uses to answer questions |

### 3.3. MCP Services (Model Context Protocol)

MCP allows the AI agent to access external tools and data during a conversation. You must implement at least **2 functional MCP servers**.

Examples of useful MCP servers:

| MCP Service | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Google Calendar** | Read/create events on Google Calendar | Schedule appointments with the professional |
| **X (Twitter)** | Post tweets, read timeline | Promote services, share updates |
| **Gmail** | Send/read emails | Confirm appointments, send information |
| **Google Sheets** | Read/write spreadsheets | Manage inventory, pricing |
| **Weather API** | Check weather | Plan outdoor services |
| **Wikipedia** | Search for information | Answer general questions |

> When creating a bot, the user must be able to select one or more of the available MCP servers on your platform.

### 3.4. Bot Creation Flow

```
[User] → Login → "New Bot" → Configure:
  1. Persona data (name, profession, photo)
  2. Service data (name, description)
  3. Write personality prompt
  4. Select MCP servers
  5. Upload documents for RAG (optional)
→ "Save" → "Publish"
→ Bot deployed to k8s
→ URL available for Hologram ✅
```

### 3.6. Final commit and documentation

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: persona AI agent creator web app"
git push origin main
```

Make sure to include:

- `README.md` with installation and usage instructions
- Screenshots of the interface
- Description of the implemented MCP integrations

### 3.7 Bonus: App Containerization and Automatic Deployment with GitHub Actions

This bonus step consists of **containerizing** your web application (Step 3) and setting up a **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions so that every time you push to `main`, your app is built, published as a Docker image to Docker Hub, and automatically deployed to Kubernetes.

#### 3.7.1. Create a Dockerfile for your web application

In the root of your web project (e.g., `web-app/`), create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: build
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

# Stage 2: production
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]
```

> Adapt paths and commands according to the framework you use (Next.js, Express, NestJS, etc.).

#### 3.7.2. Test the container locally

```bash
cd web-app

# Build the image
docker build -t my-persona-agent-creator .

# Run locally
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env my-persona-agent-creator

# Verify at http://localhost:3000
```

#### 3.7.3. Create a Docker Hub account

1. Sign up at https://hub.docker.com (free)
2. Create a repository, for example: `your-username/eafit-persona-agent-creator`

#### 3.7.4. Configure secrets in GitHub

In your GitHub fork, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add the following secrets:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Your Docker Hub username |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | A Docker Hub Access Token (Settings → Security → New Access Token) |
| `KUBE_CONFIG` | The contents of your `kubeconfig` file encoded in base64: `cat kubeconfig.yaml \| base64` |

#### 3.7.5. Create the GitHub Actions workflow

Create the file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Build, Push & Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'web-app/**'

env:
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/eafit-persona-agent-creator

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # 1. Checkout code
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Login to Docker Hub
      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3

#### 3.7.6. Complete flow

```
git push origin main
    │
    ▼
GitHub Actions triggers
    │
    ├─ Build Docker image
    ├─ Push to Docker Hub (tags: latest + commit SHA)
    ├─ Configure kubectl with your kubeconfig
    └─ Update the Kubernetes deployment with the new image
    │
    ▼
Your app updates automatically on the cluster ✅
```

Every push to `main` will deploy the new version without manual intervention. You can check the deployment status in the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.
